Get_Clean_Course_Proj

This is the README.md file for a course assignment project, authored by
Brett E. Shelton
"Getting and Cleaning Data" Offereed by Johns Hopkins as a certificate through
coursera.

For the assignment, we are charged with acquiring data regarding wearable
computing from the UCI HAR data repository.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. We are charged with creating one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
     1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Reading the Data:
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
